# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the DEAL Protocol frontend HTML project.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:
- **index.html** - Added Vercel Speed Insights tracking scripts

## Implementation Details

According to the Vercel Speed Insights documentation for HTML projects, I added the required script tags before the closing `</body>` tag:

1. **Speed Insights Initialization Script**: Added the `window.si` function initialization that queues Speed Insights events.

2. **Speed Insights Script Tag**: Added the deferred script tag that loads `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js`.

### Code Structure
The implementation follows the official Vercel documentation for HTML projects:
- No package installation required (HTML implementation doesn't need the `@vercel/speed-insights` package)
- Scripts are placed at the end of the body, just before the closing `</body>` tag
- The existing backend health check script was properly indented and moved inside the body tag for better HTML structure

## Technical Notes

- **No Dependencies Added**: For HTML projects, Speed Insights works via script tags only, no npm packages needed
- **Route Addition**: After deployment, new routes will be available at `/_vercel/speed-insights/*`
- **Deferred Loading**: The script uses `defer` attribute to avoid blocking page rendering
- **Integration**: The Speed Insights script will automatically track Core Web Vitals and performance metrics once the app is deployed to Vercel

## Next Steps

To complete the Speed Insights setup:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard for this project
2. Deploy the updated code to Vercel
3. Verify the script is loading by checking for `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` in the browser's network tab
4. View metrics in the Vercel dashboard under the "Speed Insights" tab

## Testing

The implementation is ready for deployment. Once deployed to Vercel with Speed Insights enabled:
- The tracking script will automatically begin collecting performance data
- Metrics will appear in the Vercel dashboard after users visit the site
- No additional configuration is required
